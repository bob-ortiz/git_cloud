# Purpose
This is an attempt to work on my laptop using linux. Because I do not have the possibility of syncyng Dropbox with a 3rd device for free, this is my attempt to work from Uni on linux, and also get all my files updated to the GitHub repo which will then be synced (git pull) to my desktop computer, which one pulled will be then automatically updated to Dropbox. 

# Workflow
1. Work on (edit) files on *Upar* 
2. Create a commit with date, and a brief description of what I worked on, on what was edited.
3. Push commit to main branch on github: `git push origin my-new-branch`
4. Pull new commits on desktop computer: `git pull origin master`
